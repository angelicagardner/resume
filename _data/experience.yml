  position: Software Developer Intern
  duration: Jan, 2019 &mdash; Jun, 2019
  summary:  Part of my independent degree project at Mid Sweden University. I worked on a single project under the supervision of the Head of Innovation at [A]'s R&D department. The company wanted to explore a way to improve the user experience of their chatbot project. The chatbot model was created using Google's Dialogflow platform in an ASP.NET web application. I prototyped a "Content Recommendation Module" to help this chatbot engine recommend articles that might be related to the current conversational context instead of falling into a negative fallback intent. <ol class="resume-item-list"><li>A web crawler using DotnetSpider, a . NET standard web crawling library;</li><li>Bag-of-Words model to derive recommendations from the articles;</li><li>Neo4j graph database to save the results with relationships between articles, title, keywords and paragraphs; and</li><li>GraphQL API so the chatbot agent can provide the module with words from the current conversation context. The module checks word frequency in articles and how many relationships exist between the words. It returns 1-3 URLs for the articles with the highest recommendation scores.</li></ol>
