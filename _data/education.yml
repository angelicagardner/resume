# Degree
- degree: Master of Science with specialization in Software Technology, Computer Science
  uni: Linnaeus University
  year: 2020 &mdash; 2022
  awards:
    - award: Coursework on formal methods, machine learning, code transformation and interpretation, visualization, and data mining, complemented by hands-on projects for practical experience.
    - award: My degree project was to conduct ML experiments in Jupyter notebooks to recognise pain, estimate intensity, and classify painful body areas in adults based on body movements and facial expressions. I used a hybrid CNN-BidirectionalLSTM and a recurrent CNN (RCNN) with Keras Functional API (Tensorflow 2).

- degree: Bachelor of Science, Computer Science
  uni: Linnaeus University
  year: 2019 &mdash; 2020
  awards:
    - award: Coursework on algorithms, software architecture, design patterns, and software testing.
    - award: My degree project was to design and execute controlled experiments using Sacred to evaluate the performance of deepfake detection. The study compared the effectiveness of ensemble models versus single models, utilizing the Deepfake Detection Challenge dataset from Kaggle. The following Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were implemented with PyTorch VGG19, ResNet50, VGG16, and Xception.

- degree: Higher Education Diploma with specialization in Web Development, Computer Engineering
  uni: Mid Sweden University
  year: 2017 &mdash; 2019
  awards:
    - award: Focus on full-stack web development, combining theoretical foundations with hands-on practical experience.
    - award: My degree project was to develop a content-based recommendation module with four components (1) web spider using DotnetSpider, (2) bag-of-words model using ML.NET, (3) Neo4j graph database and (4) GraphQL API to which the chatbot agent connects via Dialogflow's webhook service.
